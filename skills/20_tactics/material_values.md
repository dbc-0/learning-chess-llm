# Tactics: material values (for exchange evaluation)
ID: tactics.material_values.v1

Use these only as **heuristics** for quick exchange/blunder screening.

- Pawn (P): 1
- Knight (N): 3
- Bishop (B): 3
- Rook (R): 5
- Queen (Q): 9
- King (K): ∞ (never trade “on purpose” unless checkmating)

Notes:
- In tactics, “winning the queen” is usually decisive even if it costs 1–2 minor pieces.
- If an exchange line is unclear, prefer safety (don’t hang queen/rook).
